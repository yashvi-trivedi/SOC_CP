### 4. Add Your Weekly Solutions

* Organize your files under folders like:

  ```
  /week_1/
  /week_2/
  /week_3/
  ```
 This will be done by us already, as we have a separate README.md inside each folder containing the questions to be completed for that specific week.
 
* Name your files. Example:

  ```
  week_1/sort_colors.cpp
  week_1/kth_largest_element.py
  ```
  or
  ```
  week_1/lc_1.cpp
  week_1/cses_1.py
  ```
  You may use any kind of naming convention.

### 5. Commit and Push Your Code

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Week 1 solutions"
git push origin your-name
```

---

### 6. Create a Pull Request (PR)

* Do this once you have finished the work for that specific week.
* Go to your forked repo on GitHub.
* Click **"Compare & pull request"**.
* Set:

  * **Base repository:** `sanchitachaurasia/SOC_CP`
  * **Base branch:** `<your-name>` (⚠️ not `main`)
  * **Head repository:** your fork
  * **Head branch:** `<your-name>`
* Click **Create Pull Request**.

---

### 7. Repeat Every Week

* Add your new solutions to the same branch.
* Push changes.
* Your PR will automatically update.

## ❗ Rules & Best Practices

* Do **not** push directly to `main`.
* Submit PRs only to your **own named branch**.
* Ask doubts and share progress in the WhatsApp group.
* Write clean and readable code — include comments if necessary.
* Organize your code by week and problem.
