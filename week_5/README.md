# 📚 Week 5: Graphs

## ✅ Goals

* Gain a clear and confident grasp of essential graph algorithms.
* Build the ability to code these algorithms efficiently without relying on references.

---

## 📘 Learning Resources

* Graph-related algorithms start with the basics like BFS and DFS and stretch into more intricate areas (some of which go beyond this week's scope).
* **Main Reference:**
  📖 *Chapters 11–19* from the **Competitive Programmer’s Handbook**

> ⚠️ Prioritize **Chapters 11 to 15** for now—they’re the most relevant.
> 📌 The goal is to understand the *why* behind each algorithm, not just the *how*.
> ❓ If you hit a wall with any topic, don’t hesitate to reach out in the group—someone will guide you or recommend a better explanation.

## 📝 Helpful Advice

* Master these concepts:

  * Different ways to represent graphs (like adjacency lists vs. matrices)
  * The role of traversal order and visited flags
  * Common edge cases: disconnected graphs, cycles, directed vs. undirected behavior
  * Try small sample graphs to manually test your logic and debug

---

## 📝 Final Thoughts

* Many graph problems are more about logical reasoning than brute coding.
* By the end of this week, aim to implement core algorithms—**BFS**, **DFS**, **Dijkstra’s**, and **Topological Sort**—*without looking them up*. Practice until they come naturally.
